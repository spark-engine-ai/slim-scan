## üéØ What is CAN SLIM?

**CAN SLIM** is a growth stock investment strategy developed by William O'Neil, founder of Investor's Business Daily. The methodology has been successfully used to identify winning stocks for over 50 years, with many of the biggest stock market winners exhibiting these characteristics before their major price moves.

### Key Principles:
- **Growth over Value**: Focus on companies with accelerating earnings growth
- **Momentum Investing**: Buy stocks breaking out to new highs with volume
- **Market Leadership**: Identify leaders in leading industry groups
- **Timing**: Only invest when the overall market is in an uptrend

---

## üî§ The CAN SLIM Formula Explained

SlimScan implements each letter of the CAN SLIM acronym with precise mathematical calculations:

### **C - Current Quarterly Earnings** üìä
**What it measures**: Recent quarterly earnings acceleration compared to the same quarter last year.

**Formula**: `(Current Quarter EPS - Same Quarter Last Year EPS) / |Same Quarter Last Year EPS|`

**Why it matters**: Companies with accelerating earnings often see institutional buying and price appreciation.

**SlimScan Implementation**:
- Matches fiscal quarters within ¬±45 days (handles different fiscal year ends)
- Requires **25%+ quarter-over-quarter growth**
- Sources data from Polygon.io and Financial Modeling Prep APIs
- **Weight in scoring**: 2.0x (highest priority)

---

### **A - Annual Earnings Growth** üìà
**What it measures**: Consistent annual earnings growth over multiple years.

**Formula**: `CAGR = (Current 4Q EPS / 4Q EPS 3 Years Ago)^(1/3) - 1`

**Why it matters**: Sustained growth indicates strong business fundamentals and management execution.

**SlimScan Implementation**:
- Calculates 3-year Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR)
- Uses trailing 4 quarters to smooth seasonal variations
- Requires **25%+ annual growth rate**
- **Weight in scoring**: 2.0x (highest priority)

---

### **N - New Product, New High, New Leadership** üöÄ
**What it measures**: Stocks making new price highs, often driven by new products or management.

**Formula**: `New High % = Current Price / 52-Week High`

**Why it matters**: New highs indicate institutional accumulation and positive momentum.

**SlimScan Implementation**:
- Calculates percentage of 52-week high (requires **85%+**)
- Combines with Relative Strength ranking for additional confirmation
- Includes **breakout confirmation**:
  - Price above 50-day moving average
  - Volume spike of 1.5x+ above 50-day average
  - Close in upper 50% of daily range
- **Weight in scoring**: 1.5x

---

### **S - Supply & Demand (Volume)** üìä
**What it measures**: Heavy institutional buying evidenced by volume spikes.

**Formula**: `Volume Spike = Current Volume / 50-Day Average Volume`

**Why it matters**: Price moves without volume are unsustainable; volume confirms genuine demand.

**SlimScan Implementation**:
- Monitors daily volume vs. 50-day moving average
- Requires **1.5x+ volume spike** on breakout days
- Additional quality filter: price must close in upper half of daily range
- **Weight in scoring**: 1.5x

---

### **L - Leader or Laggard (Relative Strength)** üèÜ
**What it measures**: How a stock performs relative to the overall market and its peers.

**Formula**: `RS Percentile = (# of stocks with lower 12-month return) / (Total stocks in universe) √ó 100`

**Why it matters**: Market leaders tend to keep leading; laggards tend to keep lagging.

**SlimScan Implementation**:
- Calculates 12-month return percentile ranking within universe
- Compares against entire S&P 1500 or selected universe
- Requires **top 20% (80th percentile+)** relative strength
- Updates with each scan for accurate ranking
- **Weight in scoring**: 1.5x

---

### **I - Institutional Sponsorship** üèõÔ∏è
**What it measures**: Ownership by mutual funds, pension funds, and other institutions.

**Formula**: `Institutional Change = Current Institutional % - Previous Quarter Institutional %`

**Why it matters**: Institutional buying provides support and drives major price moves.

**SlimScan Implementation**:
- Tracks quarterly institutional ownership changes
- Sources 13F filings and ownership data from professional APIs
- Requires **increasing institutional ownership**
- Combines with ownership quality metrics (number of funds, recent additions)
- **Weight in scoring**: 1.0x

---

### **M - Market Direction** üåä
**What it measures**: Overall market trend direction using major indices.

**Formula**: `Market Uptrend = SPY > 50-day MA AND 50-day MA > 200-day MA`

**Why it matters**: "Don't fight the market" - even great stocks struggle in bear markets.

**SlimScan Implementation**:
- **Market Gate**: Prevents buy signals during market downtrends
- Monitors SPY (S&P 500 ETF) against moving averages
- Configurable index symbol and MA periods
- Blocks scans when market conditions are unfavorable

---

## üöÄ SlimScan's Implementation

SlimScan goes beyond basic screening with professional-grade implementation:

### **Scoring Algorithm**
```
Weighted Score = (C√ó2.0) + (A√ó2.0) + (N√ó1.5) + (S√ó1.5) + (L√ó1.5) + (I√ó1.0)
Final Score = (WeightedScore / MaxPossible) √ó 100
```

### **Quality Filters**
- **Liquidity**: Minimum $200,000 average daily dollar volume
- **Price**: Minimum $5 per share (eliminates penny stocks)
- **Breakout Confirmation**: Technical breakout with volume confirmation
- **Market Gate**: Only scans during favorable market conditions

### **Data Quality**
- **Fiscal Quarter Matching**: Handles different fiscal year calendars
- **Point-in-Time Data**: No lookahead bias in backtests
- **Multiple Data Sources**: Redundancy and cross-validation
- **Rate Limiting**: Respects API limits with intelligent caching
